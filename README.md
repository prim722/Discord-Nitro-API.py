# Discord-Nitro-GEN.py
Just a basic nitro gen made with python

# the language this was programed in:
Python

# used moodules
requests, 
random,  
colorama, 
json, 
time, 
os, 

If you have python installed already you can just download the source and run it
If you dont have python installed, install it or the .pyc version

# Run it on a web IDE
(alt): no install required: https://replit.com/@prim722/Nitro-Gen#main.py

Be sure to add more proxies becuase the ones i added was for testing so i didnt add many


# how it works
The scipt will randomly select letters and numbers and compile(put all the random characters together) the characters into a 16 character code, 
after it does that it will take that code and send it to Discord's API(Application programming interface)

what an API is:   
https://www.google.com/search?q=API
![090720_0532_WhatisanAPI1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74530156/126858497-b64f4f73-ccd8-4061-b3a8-45bc6152396b.png)

but before the request to the API is made, your device will send that request to a proxy sever and the proxy(https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+a+proxy) sever will send the request and wait for the API to respond,
when the API responds the proxy sever will send the response back to you

what does the proxy(proxies) a do:  
a proxy will will basically hide your ip from the API,
the reason for doing that with this is to proctect you from getting IP banned from an API,
with some ApI's; making too many requests from one IP will get that IP flagged, suspended or banned

proxy vs VPN:
 https://www.google.com/search?q=proxy+vs+vpn                                                                                                                                   .
"A proxy acts as a gateway â€“ it's ideal for basic functions like anonymous web browsing and managing (or circumventing) content restrictions. ... VPN connections encrypt and secure all of your network traffic, not just the HTTP or SOCKS calls from your browser like a proxy server"
 
if you want to create an AI algorithm for this it would increase the chance of getting a valid code but overall by itself the odds are stacked against you and there's math to back it up
